    <h1>Exploring Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of its input size. It provides a way to evaluate the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of execution time. An algorithm with lower time complexity is considered more efficient, as it can handle larger inputs without causing excessive delays. Engineers and developers strive to design algorithms that strike a balance between accuracy and speed, aiming to minimize the time required for execution while achieving the desired results.</p>
    <p>Space complexity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm uses as a function of its input size. It helps us assess the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of memory consumption. One common way to express space complexity is through the notation 'O(n)', where 'n' represents the size of the input. This nottilization.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> plays a crucial role in various computing scenarios, such as embedded systems with limited memory resources and applications that process large datasets. By analyzing an algorithm's space complexity, developers can make informed decisions about its suitability for different environments and datasets.</p>
